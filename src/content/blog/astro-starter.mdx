# Welcome to GMC Tourism

This starter combines **Astro**, **Tailwind CSS 4**, and **MDX** to deliver a blazing-fast tourism
experience that looks great on every screen. Out of the box you get optimized metadata, responsive
layouts, and a scalable content architecture powered by `src/content`.

<Callout type="tip" title="Why Astro?">
  Astro ships zero JavaScript by default, letting you craft immersive travel
  experiences without sacrificing performance. When you need interactivity,
  hydrate only the components that matter.
</Callout>

## What’s Included

- Content collections powered by **MDX** for rich storytelling
- A **Tailwind CSS 4** design system with reusable utility classes
- SEO-ready head tags, structured data, and social share images
- Production-grade folder structure for tours, destinations, and editorial content

## Next Steps

1. Duplicate this MDX file to create new travel stories.
2. Update the site configuration in `src/config/site.ts`.
3. Customize Tailwind tokens in `tailwind.config.ts` to match your branding.

Enjoy building a lightning-fast tourism experience tailored to your audience.
